IP (Internet Protocol Address)
	set of rules for communication over the internet

an IP address identifies a network or a device

two parts:

	The Network ID

	The Host ID

two types:

	Static IP address:
		stays permanent, does not change
		used for important equipement (businesses, servers...)
	
	Dynamic IP address:
		changes occasionally,
		used for consumer equipement (lapptop, smartphone, tablet...)


Purpose of the IP address

	handle the connection between devices
	that send and recieve data all across the network

	uniquely identifies every device on the internet
	(no way to contact them without an address)

	allows computing devices to communicate with destinations
	(websites, streaming services, ...)
	and let websites know who is connecting

IPv4 and IPv6

	v4: 1991
		32-bits addess
		over 4.3 billion addresses
		IP addresses must be reused and masked
		uses Numeric Dot-Decimal Notation
		(ex: 192.108.42.64)
		must be configured manually
	
	v6: 1998
		128-bits address
		over 340 undecillion addresses (36 zeros)
		every device can have it's unique IP address
		uses Alphanumeric Hexadecimal Notation
		(ex: 2002:0de6:0001:0042:0100:8c2e:0370:7234)
		supports auto-configuration


TCP/IP
(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)

	set of rules that guide and allow computers
	to communicate on the internet

	IP: obtains the address which the data is sent to

	TCP: responsible for data delivery once that address has been found


	TCP/IP divides the deifferent communication tasks into layers,
	each layers has a different function

	Data goes through 4 individual layers
	before it is recieved on the other end

	TCP/IP then goes through these layers in reverse to
	reassemble the data and represent it to its reciever

	4 layers of the TCP/IP model:

		Datalink Layer:
			also called physical layer
			handles the physical parts of sending and recieving data
			using the Ethernet, or WiFi, etc...

		Internet Layer:
			also called network layer
			controls the movement of the packets
			around the internet

		Transport Layer:
			provides reliable data connection between 2 devices
			divides the data into packets,
			knows the packets that are recieved from the other devices
			makes sure the other device knows the packets it recieves

		Application Layer:
			the group of applications that requires a network connection
			typically what the user interacts with
			(emails, messaging, etc)
			because the lower layer handles the details of communication,
			no need for applications to concern themselves with it


Switch

	device that connects devices within the same network
	usually a LAN network (a Local Area Network)
	forwards data packets to and from those devices.

	unlike a router, a switch only sends the data
	to the devices it is intended for
	(may be another switch, a router, or a user's computer)


Router

	device that connects two or more packet-switched networks
	or subnetworks

	manages the traffic between these networks by
	forwarding data packets to their intended IP addresses
	
	allows multiple devices to use the same internet connection
